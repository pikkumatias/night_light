# Night light

## Purpose

All the available 'traffic light' night lights for children have massive limitations. By utilising a small Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and a small breadboard for LED lights, you can create your very own fully customizable night light.

## How to use

* Run the script on your Raspberry Pi. Adjust the GPIO to the ones connected on your Raspberry Pi and breadboard.
* Set up a cron tab and cron job to start the script automatically in case of a reboot.
